 Widescreen fix for Sherlock Holmes Chapter One

## Screenshots

## Install

To install, download the [latest release](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/shco-wsf/releases/latest) with your desired aspect ratio (SHCO-AR-VERSION.zip) and extract the contents of the zip so that the SH9 folder in the zip file gets merged with the SH9 folder in your Sherlock Holmes Chapter One installation folder.
