## Install

1. **Ensure you have the latest [64-bit Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) installed.**
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/shco-wsf/releases/latest) with your desired aspect ratio (SHCO-WSF-AR-VERSION.zip)
3. Extract the contents of the zip so that the SH9 folder in the zip file gets merged with the SH9 folder in your Sherlock Holmes Chapter One installation folder.
4. *(Optional, recommended for 21:9)* Edit `SH9/Binaries/Win64/SUWSF.ini` and set `DesiredResolution=` to your monitor's resolution.

## Configuration

This fix is based off of version 1.1.0 of my [Somewhat Universal Widescreen Fix](https://github.com/phantomgamers/suwsf).

You can edit the `SH9/Binaries/Win64/SUWSF.ini` file with your target resolution to change the AR that is set.

This is important for the 21:9 package because the various 21:9 aspect ratios (2560x1080, 3440x1440, and 3840x1600) are all slightly different. By default the 21:9 package comes configured for 3440x1440.

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error such as "Unable to load SUWSF.asi. Error:126", ensure you have the latest [64bit VC Redist installed](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe), alternatively use the [VisualCppRedist AIO](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist) package which includes all versions of VC redist.

If the Aspect Ratio change doesn't work (i.e. you still have black bars in-game), try renaming the `SH9/Binaries/Win64/dsound.dll` to another dll name marked as supporting `x64` on [this list](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader#description)
