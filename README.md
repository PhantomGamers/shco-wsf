 Widescreen fix for Sherlock Holmes Chapter One  

Removes in-engine black bars and increases FOV to compensate.  
FOV in in-engine cutscenes and dialogue is still vert-

[Rose also has a trainer that fixes everything including FOV in in-engine cutscenes](https://github.com/RoseTheFlower/SherlockHolmesCOUltrawide) if you don't mind having to launch it each time you play the game!

## Install

1. **Ensure you have the latest [64-bit Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) installed.**
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/shco-wsf/releases/latest) with your desired aspect ratio (SHCO-WSF-AR-VERSION.zip)
3. Extract the contents of the zip so that the SH9 folder in the zip file gets merged with the SH9 folder in your Sherlock Holmes Chapter One installation folder.
4. *(Optional)* Edit `SH9/Binaries/Win64/SUWSF.ini` and set `Resolution=` to your monitor's resolution. This is only necessary if autodetection does not work for you.

## Configuration

This fix is based off of version 2.0 of my [Somewhat Universal Widescreen Fix](https://github.com/phantomgamers/suwsf).

You can edit the `SH9/Binaries/Win64/SUWSF.ini` file with your resolution if autodetection does not work for you.

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error such as "Unable to load SUWSF.asi. Error:126", ensure you have the latest [64bit VC Redist installed](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

If the Aspect Ratio change doesn't work (i.e. you still have black bars in-game), try renaming the `SH9/Binaries/Win64/dsound.dll` to another dll name marked as supporting `x64` on [this list](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader#description)
