 Widescreen fix for Sherlock Holmes Chapter One

## Screenshots

## Install

To install, download the [latest release](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/shco-wsf/releases/latest) with your desired aspect ratio (SHCO-AR-VERSION.zip) and extract the contents of the zip so that the SH9 folder in the zip file gets merged with the SH9 folder in your Sherlock Holmes Chapter One installation folder.

## Configuration

This fix is based off of version 1.1.0 of my [Somewhat Universal Widescreen Fix](https://github.com/phantomgamers/suwsf).

You can edit the `SH9/Binaries/Win64/SUWSF.ini` file with your target resolution to change the AR that is set.

This is important for the 21:9 package because the various 21:9 aspect ratios (2560x1080, 3440x1440, and 3840x1600) are all slightly different. By default the 21:9 package comes configured for 3440x1440.
